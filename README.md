# Notefinder is a note-taking application implemented in C, Perl and GTK+; an open source alternative to Evernote and alike

Notefinder can be used to keep, organize and sync various bits and pieces of personal information including but not limited to notes, bookmarks, tasks, contacts, etc. (*entries* from now on).

It's able to retrieve entries from different kinds of *sources*, for example:

* Local text files in a directory
* Google Keep
* Bookmarks from your web browser (currently Firefox is supported)

There are (currently) uncertain plans to add support for more source *backends*, for example:
* Raindrop
* Remember the Milk, etc.

I aim to make it extensible with Perl-written *hooks* (by embedding Perl within the application, think of it as if it was Lisp in Emacs).

Created solely for myself and of course just for fun.
The source code is available under BSD 0 clause license (nearly public domain).
